How to build
------------

You can find more complete instructions to build on Windows [here](https://icculus.org/gtkradiant/documentation/windows_compile_guide/) and to build on Mac OS [here](apple/README.md).

The Linux version is developed and distributed via Flatpak. See [GtkRadiant on Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.TTimo.GtkRadiant).

Building locally on Arch is the only setup that's likely to work as it's my daily driver. Ubuntu, Fedora etc. you are on your own. See the Flatpak SDK section below.

```sh
# ArchLinux
pacman -S git scons libxml2 gtk2 freeglut gtkglext subversion libjpeg-turbo
```

```sh
# get the source
git clone "https://github.com/TTimo/GtkRadiant.git"

# enter the source tree
cd GtkRadiant

# build everything
scons
```

You can build a specific part like this:

```sh
# only build the GtkRadiant level editor
scons target="radiant"

# only build the q3map2 map compiler and the q3data tool
scons target="q3map2,q3data"
```

Level editor binary (`radiant`) and tools (like `q3map2`) will be found in `install/` directory. 
The build process automatically fetches gamepacks.

Building on Linux with the Flatpak SDK
--------------------------------------

```sh
# get the flatpak manifest
git clone "https://github.com/flathub/io.github.TTimo.GtkRadiant.git"

# use flatpak-builder
cd io.github.TTimo.GtkRadiant
flatpak-builder --force-clean --user --install gtkradiant io.github.TTimo.GtkRadiant.json
```

You can also checkout the GtkRadiant tree locally and [modify the manifest to point to it](https://gist.github.com/TTimo/fd683b368048dc8802e9aaf353ef68ec).

Here is what you can do for debugging:

```sh
flatpak run --command=sh --devel io.github.TTimo.GtkRadiant
gdb /app/gtkradiant/radiant.bin
```
